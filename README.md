# factor-osc

This is the beginnings of an OSC (open sound control) vocabulary for Factor, forked from the OSC code in [timor/factor-osc](https://github.com/timor/factor-osc). Please note that I am still pretty new to Factor so please don't hesitate to open issues or pull requests.

I am primarily testing this code against SuperCollider, with additional testing against Pure Data and command line utilities like oscsend and oscdump.

I intend to submit this vocabulary for inclusion in Factor itself once it's developed and stable enough, including tests.

I also intend to write more vocabularies building on this one, for interfacing with SuperCollider, as well as general sequencing.
